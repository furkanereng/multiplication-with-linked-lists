# Multiplication with Linked Lists
This is a simple program for compute the exact result of multiplication of two positive large real numbers, where the result may cause an overflow. This is my first project assignment for Data Structures course to become familiar with Linked Lists.

# How to Run?
This is an ANSI C program. It only requires an input file named as *input.txt* that includes two numbers in separate lines with 'Multiplier:' and 'Multiplicand:' specifiers with the given order. You can directly run it after compiling the source code.
